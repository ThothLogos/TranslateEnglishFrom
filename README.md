# Reddit Bot for On-Demand Video Translation/Subtitling - Using OpenAI's Whisper (WIP)

Note: The account I personally run this bot through, /u/TranslateEnglishFrom, is
not currently active. Perhaps I will run it again when I can get my hands on a 32gb
card to fit more sophisticated models. In the mean time you can configure and attach
this to your own Reddit bot user, if you'd like.

Tag /u/TranslateEnglishFrom on Reddit to summon the bot for video/audio translation
services. WIP: automatic re-encoding and re-posting of videos with subtitles.

## Usage

You can comment/tag `/u/TranslateEnglishFrom` on Reddit in any submission that includes
an audio or video media file. You will need to tell the bot what language the material is
in!

`/u/TranslateEnglishFrom [language]`

Example:

`/u/TranslateEnglishFrom Polish`

The bot will (eventually - it takes time!) reply to the original request with
an English transcript.

## Origin / Purpose

In following recent conflicts in the Russo-Ukrainian war I was coming across 
raw/recent footage that was not translated nor subtitled. The standard solution to
this problem is hope a charitable human drops into the conversation to manually
translate.

Thanks to OpenAI's Whisper, we can summon a bot and skip the humans.
