# Reddit Bot for On-Demand Video Translation/Subtitling - Using OpenAI's Whisper (WIP)

Tag /u/TranslateEnglishFrom on Reddit to summon the bot for video/audio translation
services. Soon: automatic re-encoding and re-posting of videos with subtitles.

## Usage

You can tag `/u/TranslateEnglishFrom` on Reddit in any submission that includes
an audio or video media file. Simply enter the comments on a media submission,
and summon the bot. You will need to tell the bot what language the material is
in!

`/u/TranslateEnglishFrom [language]`

Example:

`/u/TranslateEnglishFrom Polish`

The bot will (eventually - it takes time!) reply to the original request with
an English transcript.

## Origin / Purpose

In following recent conflicts in the Russo-Ukrainian war I was coming across a lot
of raw/recent footage that was not translated/subtitled. The standard solution to
this problem is: hope a human comes along that can offer their time to provide a
translation to other users. Quite unreliable.

Thanks to OpenAI's Whisper, we can skip the humans.
